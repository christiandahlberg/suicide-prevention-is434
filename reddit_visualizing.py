# Used to visualize csv data (plotting)

# TODO:
# (1) Read data from reddit_riskzone_submissions_table.csv
# (2) Evaluate polarity scores of 'risk' column (-1, 0, 1)
# (3) Read data from 'reddit_riskzone_table.csv'
#  -  Summarize polarity scores for each user
#  -  Append csv-file with risk-factor for each user
# (4) TBD

# Results should contain visualizations of: 
# - overall sentiment analysis of submissions(?)
# - keyword frequency
# - users in riskzone vs. not in riskzone (percentages)
